# Lab 1: Employee Management System

In this first lab project, we are tasked with creating an employee database using a data structure such as a binary search tree (BST), linked list, or any other we chose to use.
In this code, a linked list based data structure is used with the three basic methods of a linked list translated from Java to C coding.

This repository includes the main code: lab1.c with all code fragments an comments of each method and its task. The code refernces this README file
to check for the outside sources used for guidance and help.

This repository also includes the header file: lab1.h that contains the method calls and structure build of the linked list.

The repository also includes this README file.

There are two main sources used for help to use methods and certain library concepts. Those sites are GeeksforGeeks and TutorialsPoint.
